üîç Power BI Project Statement: Real-Time Energy Monitoring Dashboard

Objective:
To develop a real-time Power BI dashboard that monitors and analyzes energy consumption data from multiple substations. This dashboard will enable engineers and management to track power usage trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions to improve energy efficiency and grid reliability.

üìä Key Goals:
Visualize real-time energy data such as voltage, current, power (kW), power factor, and frequency for each device and location.

Monitor device status (Active/Inactive) in real-time to identify outages or faults.

Detect anomalies like zero or unusually high/low readings which could indicate equipment issues.

Compare performance across substations using KPIs like average power usage, power factor, and uptime.

Trend Analysis to observe variations in electrical parameters over time (hourly/daily).

Create alerts and conditional formatting for critical thresholds (e.g., low power factor, voltage drops, or inactive devices).


Steps to How to start working with this , to make sure what the steps I will be taking to make the dashboards.

üìà Visuals to Include in the Dashboard:
Line charts for voltage, current, and power trends over time.

Bar/column charts comparing average power per substation.

KPI cards for overall average voltage, current, and system uptime.

Status matrix or table showing device ID, location, and current status.

Slicers/filters for Device ID, Location, Date/Time.



üéØ Key Goals:
Live Monitoring of power parameters like voltage (V), power (kW), frequency (Hz), and current (A) at the device level.

Device-Level Tracking including status (Active/Inactive), location (substation), and time-based filtering.

Performance Insights using:

KPIs for average power and voltage.

Bullet/goal charts to compare actual vs expected performance.

Anomaly Detection through sharp drops or surges in metrics over time.

Timestamp-based Analysis to correlate events or issues with specific time periods.

User-Friendly Dashboard Layout that is interactive, responsive, and visually accessible.
